// I do not completely understand what "void" is used for.  It seems like I get the same output in the terminal whether
// I have it or not. Being explicit about what I want code to do.  THe intention is for the function to run without returnign anything.

// If the point of abstraction is to hide code so the user doesn't have to worry about it, why would the user see the code anyway?
// Wouldn't they be unable to see the source code?
